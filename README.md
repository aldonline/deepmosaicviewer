Deep Mosaic Viewer

Based on Seadragon, provides extra features to operate with mosaics.
Mosaics are DeepZoom images that are made of tiles of multiple images, where each image is itself an object.

While the "widget" can be compiled into one javascript file, we contain it within a node.js project to use node's code testing and package management abilities.
